# Automate Service Operations Reports – Reduce Update Time by 95%
Problem: A bank’s Service Operations Report took a week to update, delaying decision-making and increasing errors.

Results:
✔ Report update time: 1 week → Under 30 minutes
✔ Error rate: 5-10% → <2%
✔ Analyst workload: 10+ hours/week → 1 hour/week

Impact: Faster insights, improved accuracy, and increased efficiency. Let’s discuss how I can do the same for your business!
